The files contained in the various directories correspond to various NN architectures that were tested with the two parameterisation.
All architectures in the subdirectories were trained for 25 epochs. 

The final model selected was model 4, with the layer structure,
      (1024,512,256,128,64,32,16,2), 
  using the original parameterisation (in cartesian coordinate). This model was retrained for an additionnal 50 epochs.
