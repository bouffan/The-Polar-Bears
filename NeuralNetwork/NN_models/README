The files contained in the various directories correspond to various NN architectures that were tested with the two parameterisation.
All architectures in the subdirectories were trained for 25 epochs. 

The architectures for the models are:
 - model 1 : 32,16,8,4,2
 - model 2 : 128,64,32,16,2
 - model 3 : 512,256,128,64,32,16,2
 - model 4 : 1024,512,256,128,64,32,16,2
where first input layer is ommited and all layers are dense layers

The final model selected was model 4 using the original parameterisation (in cartesian coordinate). This model was retrained for an additionnal 50 epochs.
