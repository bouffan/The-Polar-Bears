This directory contains the various notebooks that were usd to construct the NN model.

Here is a brief outlook of the contents of the notebook:
 - NN_training : notebook containing all the steps to train one NN, using the original (u,v) Cartesian parameterisation
 - NN_training_other_parameterisation : notebook containing all the steps to train one NN, using the alternate (mag,dir) polar parameterisation
 - Comparing_NN_models : a comparison of various NN architecture/parameterisation performances
 - Predictions_test_set : computes the predicted output for the test set
 
Note that the original data are required to run all the notebooks ! Also, some of the file's paths may need to be adapted.
