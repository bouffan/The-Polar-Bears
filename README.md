# The-Polar-Bears

This github contains all the notebooks that were developed for the sea-ice challenge during the Hackathon 2021.
- Feature_Engineering_and_analysis.ipynb : explore parameter space (correlation, time-dependence)
- Linear_regression.ipynb : performs a series of linear regression models on the data
- boosting.ipynb : training and predictions from a XGBoost model
- classification.ipynb : apply classification algorithm on velocity magnitude. It can be used in two steps models, where in the first step velocities are classified into categories based on their intensity, and in the second-step this category is taken as an extra feature in some other algorithms (i.e XGBoost, random forest etc.).
- NeuralNetwork : application and prediction for a series of Neural Network models
